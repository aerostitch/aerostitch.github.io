This shell command prints out the lines of the input, preceeding it with the
line numbers, like the nl command do.

[source, shell]
-----
include::perl_nl.sh[]

If you want exactly the same output than `nl` (meaning the same spacing at the
begining of the line with a right-aligned line number), you can also use this
command:

[source, shell]
-----
include::perl_nl2.sh[]
