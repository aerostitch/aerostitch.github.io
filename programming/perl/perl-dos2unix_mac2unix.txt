format from the command-line. It converts in-place ("-i" switch) the "\r\n" to
"\n" characters using a regular expression.

mac2unix
--------

Usefull command to convert a mac-formatted text file to the unix/linux
format from the command-line. It converts in-place ("-i" switch) the "\r" that
is the end of line character in mac to "\n" characters using perl built-in
capabilities.

[source, perl]

perl -w015l12pi -e1 mac_formated_file.txt

which is equivalent to the following but adds a new line at the end:

[source, perl]
