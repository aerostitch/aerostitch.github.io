This one-liner returns "little endian" if your machine is configured to use
little-endian and "big-endian" if it's configured for big!

[source, shell]
-----
include::perl-endian.sh[]

Or you can use the "Config" module like in the example bellow. If the returned
value begins with `1234` then you are on a little-endian machine. If it begins
with `4321`, then it is a big-endian one.

`87654321` is for Cray and `3412` are for weird order.
