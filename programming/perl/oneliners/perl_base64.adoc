NOTE: We are using the "MIME" Perl module here. As it is a core module, 
it should normally be installed on every systems where perl is installed.


Encode
------

This sentence returns the base64 encoded version of the input (from a file or a
pipe. Here, it is from the input_data file).

[source, shell]
-----
perl -MMIME::Base64=encode_base64 -e 'print encode_base64 join"",<>' input_data
-----


Decode
------

This command returns the decoded version of a base64 encoded input (from a
file or a pipe. Here, it is from the encoded_input_data file).

[source, shell]
-----
perl -MMIME::Base64=decode_base64 -e 'print decode_base64 join"",<>' encoded_input_data
