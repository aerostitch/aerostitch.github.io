The look-and-say mathematical sequence has been introduced and analyzed by John
Conway. If you don't know this sequence, look at the explanations given on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence[Wikipedia]. It is also konw
as the *Conway Sequence*.

This one-liner calculates the sequence until the member length is 64 or more. If
you want to change this, change the "64" at the end of the line.
