dos2unix
--------

Usefull command to convert a windows-formatted text file to the unix/linux
format from the command-line. It converts in-place ("-i" switch) the "\r\n" to
"\n" characters using a regular expression.

[source, shell]
-----
perl -pi -e's/\015\012/\012/g' dos_formated_file.txt
-----

mac2unix
--------

Usefull command to convert a mac-formatted text file to the unix/linux
format from the command-line. It converts in-place ("-i" switch) the "\r" that
is the end of line character in mac to "\n" characters using perl built-in
capabilities.

[source, shell]
-----
perl -w015l12pi -e1 mac_formated_file.txt
-----

which is equivalent to the following but adds a new line at the end:

[source, shell]
-----
perl -pi -e's/\015/\012/g' mac_formated_file.txt
