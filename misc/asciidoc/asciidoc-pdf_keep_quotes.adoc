Issue
-----

When you write some block of code with apostrophes, these are transformed by
pdflatex to backquotes. For example, this asciidoc block:

+++++
[source,bash]
-----
awk '{print $1}'
-----
+++++

Gets transformed to:
-----
awk ’{print $1}’
-----

And when it's in an IT procedure from which you use some copy/paste, it can
quickly become a nightmare.


Solution
--------

Add this line at the end of your style file:
-----
\usepackage{upquote}
-----

If you don't already have a custom one, copy the default one
(/etc/asciidoc/dblatex/asciidoc-dblatex.sty) and add the line above at the end
of it.

To generate the document using the custom style file, do it this way:
-----
a2x -fpdf -L --dblatex-opts=" -s <PATH_TO_CUSTOM_STYLE_FILE>"
<ASCIIDOC_TEXT_FILE>
-----
