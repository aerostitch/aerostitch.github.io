When the file is backed up using the default netbackup policy, use
the following command line on the master server. (Use the
`-S master_server` switch if you want to query another master server)

[source, shell]
-----
bplist -l -R /path/to/the/file.extension
-----

You also can filter by netbackup client:

[source, shell]
-----
bplist -C netbackup_client_used_for_backup -l -R /path/to/the/file.extension
-----

If you want to filter by start date, use the `-s mm/dd/yyyy  [HH:MM:SS]` switch:

[source, shell]
-----
bplist -C netbackup_client_used_for_backup  -s 06/20/2014 -l -R /path/to/the/file.extension
-----

If your file has not been backed up using the default policy, use:

[source, shell]
-----
bplist -C netbackup_client_used_for_backup -t netbackup_policy -l -R /path/to/the/file.extension
-----
