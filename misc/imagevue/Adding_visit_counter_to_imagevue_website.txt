Introduction
------------

Imagevue is an image gallery and portfolio available at
http://www.imagevuex.com.

The goal of this document is to describe how to add a visit counter to the
bottom of the website.


Get a visit counter tool
------------------------

There's a lot of website providing this type of tools. Here, we went to the
http://compteurdevisite.com . There you will choose your counter and they will
provide you a script tag that looks like the example bellow (the character sentence at the end
of the src attribute should vary). This is the part that will be included at the
bottom of your website.

[source, html]
-----
<script type="text/javascript"
src="http://counter3.compteurdevisite.com/private/counter.js?c=vcneo8641651vpsdf57tinvqmdf864"></script>
-----


Modify index.gallery.phtml
--------------------------

The `index.gallery.phtml` file should be located in the `iv-includes/templates/`
folder relatively to the root of your directory.

At the very end of this page, just before this following lines that represent
the closing tags for the html and body tags...

[source, html]
-----
</body>
</html>
-----

add the following code:

[source, html]
-----
<div style="width:100%; text-align:center">
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://counter3.compteurdevisite.com/private/counter.js?c=vcneo8641651vpsdf57tinvqmdf864"></script>
</div>
-----

Then modify the css file as explained bellow.


Modifying imagevue.flash.css
----------------------------

The `imagevue.flash.css` file is located in the `iv-includes/assets/css/`
directory (this is relative to the root of your website).

There you'll need to find the declaration of the imagevue id that should be
empty. It should look like this:

[source, css]
-----
#imagevue { }
-----

You need to modify this to change the size of the container to 95% of the whole
page. You do it adding `height: 95%` in the brackets of the previously finded
imagevue declaration tag. It should look like this:

[source, css]
-----
#imagevue { height:95% }
-----

And that's it!
