Where to begin: an ontroduction of packaging process in Debian:

Build environments are restricted environments. To have and overview of that,
see: https://wiki.debian.org/buildd

Look at what's on your computer that needs help, install the 'devscripts' and
'how-can-i-help' packages. From the first, use the `rc-alert` and `wnpp-alert`
scripts. From the later, use the `how-can-i-help -o` or (if you want to help on
packages not installed on your computer yet) `how-can-i-help -a`.

Tools for testing your packages
