Where to begin: an ontroduction of packaging process in Debian:
http://mentors.debian.net/intro-maintainers

Build environments are restricted environments. To have and overview of that,
see: https://wiki.debian.org/buildd

Look at what's on your computer that needs help, install the 'devscripts' and
'how-can-i-help' packages. From the first, use the `rc-alert` and `wnpp-alert`
scripts. From the later, use the `how-can-i-help -o` or (if you want to help on
packages not installed on your computer yet) `how-can-i-help -a`.

To have a complete overview of how to maintain a package, refer to the official
maintainer guide: http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide

Tips
----

*Don't do NMU* (Non Maintainer Uploads) on packages with maintainers.
NMU is more considered as something quite rude than a grood practice.
If you have corrected a bug, provide the patch. An upload will be 
made by the maintainer when he founds some time and enough bugs to
make a release.

*Take your time* !
