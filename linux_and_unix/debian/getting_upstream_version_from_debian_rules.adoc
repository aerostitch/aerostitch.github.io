  debian/rules file of a package.

If you're using cdbs, it's simple: use the "$(DEB_UPSTREAM_VERSION)" variable
defined in the /usr/share/cdbs/1/rules/buildvars.mk file.

Else, you'll have to redefine it. I personally use:

-----
DEB_UPSTREAM_VERSION ?= $(shell dpkg-parsechangelog \
                          | sed -rne 's/^Version: ([0-9.]+)[-+].*$$/\1/p')
-----

But if you want, you can still use exactly the same way as cdbs did (also added
some other usefull variables that were defined in this makefile):

-----
# Gets the name of the source package
DEB_SOURCE_PACKAGE := $(strip $(shell egrep '^Source: ' debian/control | cut -f 2 -d ':'))

# Gets the full version of the source package including debian version
DEB_VERSION := $(shell dpkg-parsechangelog | egrep '^Version:' | cut -f 2 -d ' ')
DEB_NOEPOCH_VERSION := $(shell echo $(DEB_VERSION) | cut -d: -f2-)
# Gets only the upstream version of the package
DEB_UPSTREAM_VERSION := $(shell echo $(DEB_NOEPOCH_VERSION) | sed 's/-[^-]*$$//')

# Prints the version line if the package is native. Nothing for a non native package
DEB_ISNATIVE := $(shell dpkg-parsechangelog | egrep '^Version:' | perl -ne 'print if not /^Version:\s*.*-/;')
