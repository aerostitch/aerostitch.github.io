 rules is easy!

First, remember that on RHEL, iptables config file is `/etc/sysconfig/iptables`
and the service logs by default to `/var/log/messages`.

For this example, our internal network is 193.168.1.0/24 and we are setting our
server as a gateway with eth1 on local network and eth0 that has access to the
internet.

[source, shell]
-----
# First allow ip forwarding at kernel level
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
# Then set your iptables rules
iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -o eth0 -s 193.168.1.0/24 -j MASQUERADE
iptables -I FORWARD 1 -i eth1 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I FORWARD 2 -i eth0 -o eth1 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
# Finally save and restart service
service iptables save
service iptables restart
# Now check your rules
iptables -L -n -v
iptables --table nat -L -n -v
-----

IMPORTANT: You will need to add the line `net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1` or change it to
that value in `/etc/sysctl.conf` to be sure the change will survive next reboot!

Now you have to put this host's eth1 IP as a gateway in your
`/etc/sysconfig/network` file if not already done (if there's already a gateway,
replace it!):

[source, shell]
-----
echo "GATEWAY=193.168.1.1" >> /etc/sysconfig/network
-----

Now you can start to try and ping servers outside your network.
