If you've lost your `/etc/inittab` in a RHEL or Centos environement, recovering
it is quite easy:

 1. Boot to single user mode (eg: add "single" at the end of your grub options)
 2. Mount your cdrom or iso to /mnt (`mount /dev/cdrom /mnt`)
 3. Find which package provides inittab (`yum -q --whatprovides /etc/inittab`)
 4. Go to /mnt and find your rpm package which is actually "initscripts"
 (`find /mnt -name '*initscripts*'`)
 5. Reinstall your the corresponding package which, for centos 6.5 is located
 in the `Packages` subdirectory if the cd.
 (`rpm -Uv --force /mnt/Packages/initscripts-*.rpm`)
