ACL
---

First of all, to play with acl, you must naturally have the `acl` package
installed.

Then, to use acl on a file system, you must mount it with the `acl` options
(either in the `/etc/fstab` or temporarly using `mount -o acl,remount /fs`).

.Commands to use
 * `getfacl file01` -> Displays the acl of file01
 * `setfacl -m u:user01:rx file01` -> Allows user01 to read and execute file01
 even if he's neither owner nor in the right group (and that other have no
 permission on the file). `-R` can be used for recursive grant.
 * `setfacl -x g:group01 file01` -> Removes the acl permission sets to the
 group01 group on file01.
 * `setfacl -b file01` -> Blanks (removes all) acl permissions (fall back to
 classic permissions mode).
