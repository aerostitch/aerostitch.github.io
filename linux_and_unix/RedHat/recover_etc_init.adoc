 directory in the context of a Red Hat based distribution.
:keywords: Centos, RedHat, RPM, initscripts, upstart


 1. Add "selinux=0 init=/bin/sh" at the end of the "kernel" line in grub
 2. Check if /var/lock is writable via `touch /var/lock/toto`
 3. If not, remount the filesystem in writable mode via `mount -o rw,remount /`
 (if your /var is on /...)
 4. Check which packages are to be reinstalled via `yum -C provides /etc/init*`
 5. Mount installation CD via `mount -r -t iso9660 /dev/sr0 /mnt`
 6. Reinstall upstart and initscripts via
 `rpm -Uv --force --noscripts /mnt/Packages/upstart*.rpm /mnt/Packages/initscripts*.rpm`
 7. Verify there is no more missing files from the packages via
 `rpm -V initscripts` and `rpm -V upstart` and `rpm -Vf /etc/init`
 8. Unmount CD, eject disk and reboot (unsing `reboot -f`)

NOTE: You can also boot from the cdrom rescue mode.
