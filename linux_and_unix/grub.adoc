In GRUB's configuration file, the `(hd0, 0)` means to load the bootloader from
the partition 0 of the hd0 drive.

In RHEL6, the GRUB version used is 0.97 so you can still edit the
`/boot/grub/grub.conf` manually unlinke GRUB 2.0.

From GRUB's command line:

 * To find the partition containing GRUB's conf file: `find /grub/grub.conf` or
 simply `root`
 * To reinstall grub on hd0: `setup (hd0)`

To boot in maintenance mode (`init 1` / `telinit 1` equivalent) from the grub
menu, just append `single` to the boot arguments to the "kernel" line.

If you are booting by default on runlevel 5 and that you want to reboot in
runlevel 3, just add " 3" at the end of the kernel line at the grub prompt.
Tested on Centos.
