Since RHEL 6 or in Ubuntu, SysV has been replaced by Upstart.

Each process to start with Upstart is a job, is defined in the `/etc/init`
directory. And each event is now in the `/etc/event.d` directory.

With Upstart, `/etc/inittab` is now deprecated and used only to look it to know
the initdefault parameter.

The `/etc/rc.d/rc` script is not called directly anymore. Upstart only looks
into the conf files placed in the `/etc/init` directory. `/etc/rc.d/rc` is now
called via the `/etc/init/rc.conf` file.

You use the `initctl` command to interact with Upstart jobs quite similarly to
the `service` command. For example, use `initctl list` to list Upstart jobs.
