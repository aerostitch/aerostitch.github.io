On RHEL, the `tcp_wrappers` is the package that provides TCP wrappers
capability.

IMPORTANT: TCP wrappers looks first in `/etc/hosts.allow` then in
`/etc/hosts.deny`. If not found in either, it allows the access.

/etc/hosts.(allow|deny) files format is: `daemon_list : client_list`.

The `client_list` field could be either a hostname or an IP, or one of the
following:

 * `ALL` -> For all networks
 * `LOCAL` -> For the local network
 * `EXCEPT` -> To exclude a particular user or client
 * `KNOWN` -> All hosts that can be resolved by the system
 * `UNKNOWN` -> All hosts that can't be resolved by the system
 * `PARANOID` -> Case when the forward and reverse lookup IP address don't match

Example: `sshd : 192.168.1. EXCEPT 192.168.1.30`

TCP wrappers usually log into `/var/log/secure`.
